Overview
This is a real-time weather monitoring system for Indian metro cities, retrieving weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displaying it in both the terminal and a web interface. The system calculates daily weather rollups, triggers alerts based on user-configurable thresholds, and stores daily summaries in a MongoDB database for further analysis.

Features
Weather Data: Fetches current weather data for Indian metros (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad).
Temperature Unit Conversion: Converts temperature to Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin based on user input.
Daily Aggregates: Calculates average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and determines the dominant weather condition.
Alert System: Alerts the user if the temperature exceeds the user-configured threshold.
Web Interface: Displays weather data, alerts, and daily summaries in a simple web interface.
Data Persistence: Stores daily summaries in MongoDB for further analysis.
